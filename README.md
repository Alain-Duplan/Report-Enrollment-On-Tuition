There has been a recent trend of the University of Massachusetts in regard to enrolling students. In
order to fit the surplus students, the university made a portion of common rooms and z-rooms into triples
and quads, and extended hours of dining services. Given that more students are admitted each year, it
was brought to light that the current size of the enrolled student body was affecting the price of tuition
and dormitories. To hypothesize, The enrollment number of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst
can be used to determine the cost of being a residential student. Using the public data provided by the
institution, a study was conducted to analyze the relationship between the cost of attending UMass and
the enrollment statistics. To account for the increasing population and value of higher education, the rate
of change was used to predict how much the cost of attending increases upon each given year. Using step
linear regression and random foresting, 2 models were able to be created to predict the rate of change within
an average 3% margin of error. Both were able to show that enrollment was the primary predictor with high
statistical significance. This would lead to suggest that the rate of which cost of attendance increases by is
determined by the rate of which student enrollment increases by.
