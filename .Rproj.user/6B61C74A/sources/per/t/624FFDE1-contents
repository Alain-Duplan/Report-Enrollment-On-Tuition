## Data is a collection of reports made by Umass that can be found on:

```{r}

## Data Set of fees and enrollment numbers for undergraduate students attending umass. In-state and out-state are nets of tuition and fees. Room and board including base meal plan and room fees(normal double). Enrollment, applications, acceptance and admission are for undergraduates in the fall semester.

```{r}
# add an acceptance & admission rate colum
UMASS$ACCRATE <- UMASS$ACCEPTANCE / UMASS$APPLICATIONS 
UMASS$ADMRATE <- UMASS$ADMISISSION / UMASS$ACCEPTANCE
